**About Me**

I am a linguist working on evaluating the humanlike-ness of artificially "intelligent" models for natural language. Most of my research falls into a few main themes. First, much of my work evaluates whether deep neural networks are reasonable cognitive models of the human language faculty and of human language processing, with the goal of understanding model failings so as to better improve them. Second, I collect and curate datasets for training and testing models on particular natural language understanding tasks. Third, I have been exploring ways to measure social biases in NLP models, to create safer, more inclusive, and more equitable models. I also enjoy theoretical questions about the nature of language, including ones about the structure of the human language faculty, the relationship(s) between meaning and form, and about the abstract computations that undergird language. 

I am a research scientist at the [Fundamental AI Research Laboratories (FAIR Labs) at Meta Platforms, Inc.](https://ai.facebook.com/people/adina-williams) in New York City. Before that, I recieved my PhD in [Linguistics from New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics/homepage.html). Before that I did a MA in [Linguistics at Michigan State University](https://lilac.msu.edu/linguistics/), and a BSc in [Neuroscience](https://lsa.umich.edu/neurosci) and [Asian Studies (Chinese)](https://lsa.umich.edu/asian) at the University of Michigan.
