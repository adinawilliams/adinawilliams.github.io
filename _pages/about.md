My work focuses on computational linguistics and natural language processing. Much of my time is spent on creating better tools and benchmarks to evaluate models for language, and/or on cognitive modeling. I am also interested in measuring social biases in NLP models, and in making them safer, more inclusive, and more equitable. See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MUtbKt0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) profile for an updated publications list.

My background is in linguistics, so I also enjoy theoretical questions about the structure of the human language faculty, the characterization of the abstract computations that undergird language, and the relationship(s) between meaning and form. 

I am a research scientist at the [Fundamental AI Research Laboratories (FAIR Labs) at Meta Platforms, Inc.](https://ai.facebook.com/people/adina-williams) in New York City. I recieved my PhD in [Linguistics from New York University](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/linguistics/homepage.html). Before that, I did a MA in [Linguistics at Michigan State University](https://lilac.msu.edu/linguistics/), and a BSc in [Neuroscience](https://lsa.umich.edu/neurosci) and [Asian Studies (Chinese)](https://lsa.umich.edu/asian) at the University of Michigan.
